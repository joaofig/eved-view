# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the eVED Viewer application.

## Database Operations

### Connection Pooling in BaseDb

**File:** `tools/database/sqlite/BaseDb.py`

**Optimizations:**
- Implemented connection pooling with thread-local storage
- Added proper connection management with try-finally blocks
- Added chunked query support for large datasets
- Optimized table existence check with direct query
- Added null check in query_scalar

**Impact:**
- Reduced connection overhead by reusing connections
- Improved reliability with proper resource cleanup
- Enabled efficient processing of large result sets
- Improved performance of metadata operations

## Geometric Calculations

### Vectorized Haversine Distance Calculation

**File:** `app/geo/geomath.py`

**Optimizations:**
- Vectorized the `outer_haversine` function using NumPy broadcasting
- Eliminated loops in favor of vectorized operations
- Improved readability with better code organization

**Impact:**
- Significantly faster distance calculations for large datasets
- Reduced memory usage by avoiding intermediate arrays
- Better utilization of CPU vectorization capabilities

### Vectorized Circle to Polygon Conversion

**File:** `app/geo/geomath.py`

**Optimizations:**
- Vectorized the `circle_to_polygon` function
- Eliminated loop in favor of NumPy array operations
- Pre-calculated trigonometric functions

**Impact:**
- Faster polygon generation, especially for circles with many points
- Reduced CPU usage through vectorized operations
- More efficient memory usage

### Optimized Polyline Decoding

**File:** `app/geo/geomath.py`

**Optimizations:**
- Added early return for empty input
- Pre-calculated string length
- Attempted result list pre-allocation
- Simplified loop structure
- Eliminated unnecessary string formatting
- Added boundary checks

**Impact:**
- Faster polyline decoding, especially for large polylines
- Reduced memory allocations
- Improved robustness with boundary checks

## Data Processing

### Optimized Trip Data Loading

**File:** `app/models/trip.py`

**Optimizations:**
- Added adaptive processing based on dataset size
- Used NumPy structured arrays for faster iteration
- Pre-allocated lists for better performance
- Added caching to avoid redundant loading

**Impact:**
- Faster loading of trip data, especially for large datasets
- Reduced memory usage through more efficient data structures
- Improved responsiveness through lazy loading

## UI Operations

### Optimized Map View Model

**File:** `app/viewmodels/map.py`

**Optimizations:**
- Added trace cache to speed up existence checks
- Implemented spatial indexes for shapes
- Added collection change listeners to maintain indexes
- Added early returns in shape selection

**Impact:**
- Faster UI operations, especially with many shapes
- Reduced CPU usage through cached lookups
- Improved responsiveness when selecting shapes

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Implement a true spatial index**: Replace the simple dictionary-based spatial index with a more efficient data structure like an R-tree or quadtree for faster spatial queries.

2. **Add pagination for large datasets**: Implement pagination in the UI to load and display data in chunks, reducing memory usage and improving responsiveness.

3. **Implement background loading**: Move data loading operations to background threads to avoid blocking the UI.

4. **Add data compression**: Compress large datasets in memory to reduce memory usage.

5. **Profile with real-world data**: Use profiling tools with real-world data to identify additional bottlenecks.

## Measuring Performance Improvements

To measure the impact of these optimizations:

1. Use Python's `cProfile` module to profile the application before and after optimizations.
2. Measure load times for large datasets.
3. Monitor memory usage during operation.
4. Test UI responsiveness with many shapes on the map.

Example profiling command:

```python
python -m cProfile -o profile.out main.py
```

Then analyze the results with:

```python
import pstats
from pstats import SortKey

p = pstats.Stats('profile.out')
p.strip_dirs().sort_stats(SortKey.CUMULATIVE).print_stats(30)
```
